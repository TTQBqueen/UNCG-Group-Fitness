## Description

> The UNCG Group Fitness App is an application that allows UNCG students to sign up for different fitness classes provided by class instructors.

> Students are able to see the materials needed and/or provided for each class, as listed by the instructor under each class description. Instructors can create, delete, and modify classes. They can then schedule classes at specific times for students to pick. Administrators can oversee messages and classes, allowing them to flag and delete content.

> The motivation for this app is to encourage UNCG students to improve their health and well-being. Our main goal is to give individuals the opportunity to select the fitness class that they feel most comfortable with. Scheduling a fitness course will be based on their availability, comfort level, fitness instructor, and level of fitness. 

> The UNCG Group Fitness App will help to solve the issue of availability issues. Therefore, individuals will now have the opportunity to schedule a fitness course based on their availability, intensity of the fitness course, and comfortability with the instructor.
